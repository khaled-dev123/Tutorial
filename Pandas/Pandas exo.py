# 1. DataFrame Creation & Construction
# Goal: Learn all ways to create a DataFrame and manipulate its structure.
# ✅ Must-Do Exercises:
# Make a DataFrame from a two-dimensional list.
# Create a DataFrame from a dict of lists/arrays.
# Create a DataFrame from a list of dicts.
# Construct a DataFrame from list of tuples.
# Convert list of nested dictionaries into a DataFrame.
# Create a DataFrame from Pandas Series.
# Construct a DataFrame from string data and clean string values.
# These cover almost all possible ways to create a DataFrame.

# 2. DataFrame Indexing & Reindexing
# Goal: Understand row/column access and reshaping.
# ✅ Must-Do Exercises:
# Reindexing in Pandas DataFrame.
# Reset Index in Pandas DataFrame.
# Change column names and row indexes.
# Mapping external values to DataFrame values.
# Reshape DataFrame using stack, unstack, and melt.
# Mastering these ensures you can organize, reshape, and map your data effectively.

# 3. DataFrame Row Operations
# Goal: Master row selection, iteration, and modification.
# ✅ Must-Do Exercises:
# Select rows based on conditions.
# Use iloc[] and iat[] for row selection.
# Drop rows based on a condition.
# Insert a row at a given position.
# Iterate over rows in multiple ways.
# Select row with maximum/minimum value.
# Randomly select rows from the DataFrame.
# These exercises cover almost all row-level manipulations you will need.

# 4. DataFrame Column Operations
# Goal: Manipulate, analyze, and transform columns.
# ✅ Must-Do Exercises:
# Create new columns (from existing columns, loops, or conditions).
# Rename columns and lowercase/uppercase/capitalize column names.
# Get unique values from a column.
# Conditional operations on columns.
# Split a column into multiple columns using regex or string methods.
# Column arithmetic: difference, sum, or derived calculations.
# Get n-largest/n-smallest values from a column.
# Drop columns effectively.
# Frequency counts of column values.
# Change data types for columns.
# Column manipulation is one of the most used skills in real-world Pandas tasks.

# 5. DataFrame Cleaning
# Goal: Prepare clean data for analysis.
# ✅ Must-Do Exercises:
# Remove or fill empty cells (dropna, fillna).
# Fix wrong data formats (astype).
# Fix wrong data using apply() and conditions.
# Remove duplicates (drop_duplicates).
# Clean string columns using regex, str.replace, str.strip, etc.
# This ensures your datasets are analysis-ready.

# 6. Pandas Series
# Goal: Work efficiently with 1D data.
# ✅ Must-Do Exercises:
# Create a Series from arrays, lists, or dictionaries.
# Create a Series using NumPy functions.
# Access elements by index, label, or slicing.
# Perform vectorized operations on a Series.
# Mastering Series helps you work with single columns efficiently.

# 7. Pandas Date & Time
# Goal: Handle time-series data effectively.
# ✅ Must-Do Exercises:
# Convert string columns to datetime (pd.to_datetime).
# Work with Timedelta and Period for date/time calculations.
# Manipulate time-series indexes for analysis.
# Date and time operations are critical for finance, analytics, and sensor data.

# 8. Analyzing DataFrames
# Goal: Quickly explore datasets for insights.
# ✅ Must-Do Exercises:
# Use head() and tail() to preview data.
# Use info() to check data types and null values.
# Use describe() for quick statistics.
# Count null values per column (isnull().sum()).
# Get row/column summaries using sum(), mean(), value_counts().
# These exercises make you confident in exploratory data analysis (EDA).
